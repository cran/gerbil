Description: Implements a new multiple imputation method that draws
    imputations from a latent joint multivariate normal model which
    underpins generally structured data. This model is constructed using a
    sequence of flexible conditional linear models that enables the
    resulting procedure to be efficiently implemented on high dimensional
    datasets in practice.
